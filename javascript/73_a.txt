Asynchronous Code(running at background without blocking other code)

There are a few ways to work with Async code.
These help us to write Aync code :
# Callbacks
# Promises
# Async/Await


AJAX : 
        # Asyncronous javaScript and XML
        # Set of web technologies
        # Send and Receive data Asyncronously
        # Does not interfere with the current page
        # JSON has replace XML for the most part
        # Make async request in the background
        # No page reload/refresh
        # Fetch data
        # Very interactive

  
AJAX :  # AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML
        # AJAX is not a programming language
        # AJAX is a technique for accessing web servers from a web page.
        # AJAX is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages.
        # AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind 
          the scenes
        # Making request on the page while its already or after its loaded

AJAX :  # AJAX uses XHR object to achieve this
        # Data can be transfered in any format and protocol (Not Always https necessarily)



Most Async code you work with will be part of an API or Library
(With help of this we can make request to server)

# XHR
# Fetch, AXIOS, other HTTP libraries
# Node.js fs(filesystem) Module
       

XMLHttpRequest(XHR) object: 
# API in the form of an object
# Provided by the browser JS environment 
# Methods to transfer data between client/ server
# Can be used with other protocols than HTTP
# Can work with data other than XML (JSON,plain text)


There are Libraries and Other mothods to make http request :
# Fetch API
# Axios
# Superagent
# jquery (not prefered)
# Node HTTP
(Now it is upto you how you make http request)


PREFERED ONE : 1. Fetch API (coz it's part of vannila JavaScript)
               2. Axios & Superagent (external library make code easy)
               3. Node HTTP

NOT PREFERED : 1. AJAX(XHR(XMLHttpRequest)) (coz it's older one)
               2. jquery (coz its totally dom manipulation library) 



Asynchronous programming --> how to write Asynchronous code --> with help of Callbacks, Promises, async/Await --> why to write Asynchronous code ?
--> for do not disturbing other code coz it may take time --> To make Asynchronous http request to servers/APIs --> by help of following 
technologies (like AJAX, axios, Fetch) --> data comes in format of JSON/XML/text  -->
